<section class="introduction">
	<h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
	<p>I&rsquo;m a Front End and iOS developer who loves <strong>good design</strong>, <strong>good coffee</strong>, and <strong>good people</strong>. I work as a Front-End Development and iOS mentor for Thinkful, a web developer for <a href="http://ideabasekent.com">IdeaBase</a>, and a freelance iOS developer.</p>
	<p>I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I&rsquo;m excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It&rsquo;s easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet.</p>
	<p>Education is also super important to me - I come from a family of educators - and I&rsquo;m stoked to work with Thinkful&rsquo;s awesome student community.</p>

	<h1 class="heading">Where I&rsquo;m From</h1>
	<p>I&rsquo;m from the Midwest - Ohio, specifically - Cleveland, even more specifically. I love the spacious fields, the smell of the outdoors, and the people in Ohio. I bring a bit of the Midwest work ethic to all my projects - a craftsman&rsquo;s approach to <strong>Doing Things Right the First Time</strong>.</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;m finishing my design degree at Kent State University, and will be graduating this winter with a focus in <strong>interaction design</strong>.</p>
